60 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SURFS
================================

Artificial Intelligence is our journey into the wonderful workings of one of the most complex 
mysteries in human physiology, the work of the brain, as much as it is an endeavour to change 
the world and improve lives.

::

  A single neuron in the brain is an incredibly complex machine that even today we don't understand. 
  A single 'neuron' in a neural network is an incredibly simple mathematical function that 
  captures a minuscule fraction of the complexity of a biological neuron. 
  - Andrew Ng


Through Artificial Intelligence, we seek to tap into the incredible power of our human brains - 
we only need a fraction of that power - to make us more efficient and effective at doing the 
things we love.

Let's explore Artificial Intelligence, and especially Secure and Private AI, through the power of 
the python programming language and facebook's pytorch.
