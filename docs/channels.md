### What are channels? 

The first simple answer: Channels control the colors displayed in an image.

### How do channels control image colors?

First, all images can be thought of as several dots of different colours, or shades of colors. These dots are called pixels. For the commonest system we use, the colors of pixels are obtained by combining different amounts of RED, GREEN and BLUE(RGB).
For ease of use, the amounts of these three colors can be 255(full) or 0(empty). For example, if we want pure color RED, we will have 255(full) of RED, 0 of GREEN and 0 of BLUE.

For the RGB system, the RED, GREEN, BLUE we use to tune the colors are called CHANNELS. You can look at them like three knobs we will use to obtain a given color.

There are several other systems and thus channels. RED, GREEN, BLUE channels are just one of many channels there can be. 
For example, black and white images have only one channel where 255(full) is white and 0 is black. They is also the HSV system where channels represent HUE, SATURATION and VALUE, which can also be tuned just like RGB channels to obtain desired colors.
