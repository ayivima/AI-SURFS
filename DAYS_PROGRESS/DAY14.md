### HIGHLIGHT: CONTINUED MATRIX TOOLS: THE SECOND MAJOR PROJECT FOR THE STREAK, ADDING UP TO VECTORKIT

1. Work continues on matrix tools: the sequel to VectorKit. Implemented
Matrix multiplication, transposition, scalar multiplication, Hadamard Product
Matrix Addition, Matrix Subtraction, Matrix-Vector Multiplication, 
Generation of nxn identity matrix!

2. Continued my second "epoch" through the course, locally: 
Continually having fun with `torch`.

3. I met Laplace again...Haha...This time, not for 'Laplacian noise', 
but for Laplace (or cofactor) expansion, for deriving the determinant 
to be used for calculating the inverse of a matrix.
