RETROSPECTION OF MY 30-DAY JOURNEY

PROJECTS:
1. VectorKit - https://github.com/ayivima/vectorkit

2. MatrixKit - https://github.com/ayivima/matrixkit

3. Pytorch Wrappers (More of Personal Gain)

SOME NOTABLE MOMENTS:

1. Proof of Concept for CNN Architecture/Algorithms
Thanks to @Shaam ...He had an interesting project that was to test correlation between images. That was the beggining of this particular experimental journey. There were three images of apples. Using core python, numpy and PIL, I sought to get correlation between them. It did well with two of the images...They all had white backgrounds and similar sized apples...The other one had an apple that was like one in the other images but the code reported poor correlation.
And, CNNs made sense...a blind multilayer perceptron, of course, would be helpless and hopeless.
Materials from my first exploit here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Power_Of_Math_In_Image_Analysis/

2. I further explored the weaknesses of Perceptrons by using toy Multilayer Perceptrons to determine colours within colours. That was a furtherance on the toy Multilayer perceptron here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/RGBYCM_Color_Classifier/

3. A further dive into CNNs involved exploration of Mathematical Dynamic System Theory(it has interesting applications in human behaviour, and makes sense in CNN applications and neural networks), and the power behind convolutions. I share some of my resources: It is quite easy on the brain to start with these... https://www.britannica.com/science/analysis-mathematics/Dynamical-systems-theory-and-chaos#ref732355, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23786997_A_view_of_Neural_Networks_as_dynamical_systems/link/0fcfd50a90b0b1a417000000/download

4. Then, I was fascinated by the adoption of CNNs for Natural Language Processing...and the debate on its preference over RNNs.
This was how I got back to the book "Mathematics of Language" [http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/formal.alt.pdf], to be able to appreciate the notions better. But, I have been more fascinated at how there is a link between language acquisition and the Dynamic System Theory: https://www.rug.nl/staff/c.l.j.de.bot/debotetal2007-bilingualism.pdf

With that surface retrospection, I think I am poised to push further to my next phase, Phase 2, of this challenge!
