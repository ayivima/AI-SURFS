### SPENT MORE TIME ON QUICKNETS WRAPPER - NEW MILESTONES TODAY, PYBYTES CONTINUED

1. Added new functionality to my Pytorch wrapper: QUICKNETS. Tested it out on FashionMNIST and glad with the outcomes. Among a couple milestones, looking at training different models with different tunings and comparing them more conveniently, and tweaking outputs.
