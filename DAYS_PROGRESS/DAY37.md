### A PACKED DAY: BLOSSOMING FINDINGS ON CNN AND NLP

1. Investigating BERT and OpenAI's GPT-2. These two have an interesting rivalry. Commentary has it that BERT outperformed GPT, until GPT-2 emerged to muddy the waters this year. 
So, my curiosity regards the optimal between the left-to-right next-word approach of GPT-2 versus the bidirectional what-is-before-and-after approach of BERT.

2. Accessed integration options for spaCy and Pytorch. I came across this interesting library: https://pypi.org/project/spacy-pytorch-transformers/.
But, foremost the CNN-NLP alignment was vindicated: spacy 2.0 uses CNN for tagging, parsing and entity recognition. https://spacy.io/usage/v2#features-models
It's a huge boost to the non-RNN path.

3. I went over some of the course notebooks and miniprojects. I have heightened interest in production-grade differential privacy and federated learning.
