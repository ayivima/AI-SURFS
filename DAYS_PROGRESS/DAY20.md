DAY 20:
=======

ACTIVITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### HAD SO MUCH TO DO

1. Resumed reading this book, "The Mathematics of Language": http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/formal.alt.pdf. I am sharing it, especially, with NLP lovers. 
The day I accepted that the entire world could be described in math, was the day I had my AI epiphany.

2. Squeezed some time to spend in the Udacity workspace.

3. I and @Stark are busy on a side project...And working on stirring up activity in #sg_novice-ai.

4. ...And, I am still at implementing concepts at a bare-bones level: Matrix tools and its "spin-offs"
