### HIGHLIGHT: BUILT A SINGLE-LAYER NEURAL NETWORK WHICH CLASSIFIES SHADES OF GREEN FROM NON-SHADES OF GREEN, WITH CORE PYTHON

1. As almost always, I leveraged only python to build
a simple shades of green classifier. It worked well, but for
it's confusion with yellow. It was an amazing experience to 
implement the workings of NN from scratch. Snapshots below.
Link to demo here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/edit/master/Green_shade_classifier/README.rst

2. Reverted to beginning of course and released a completed 
notebook to github. https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Udacity_DL_With_Pytorch_Exercises/Part%201%20-%20Tensors%20in%20PyTorch%20(Exercises).ipynb

3. Resumed Pytorch tinkering :)
