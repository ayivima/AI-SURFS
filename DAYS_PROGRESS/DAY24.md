### DRIVING SG_NOVICE-AI DEEPER INTO PYTORCH WITH PYBYTES 

1. Still busy with creating PYBYTES in #sg_novice-ai. We have successfully implemented equivalents of tensor normalization, tensor flattening, getting tensor shapes, and tensor reshaping.
------------

**A TEASER:** We successfully demonstrated, in vanilla code, how reshaping with `tensor.view` will change this, a `6 X 2` matrix to:
```
P = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8],
    [9, 10],
    [11, 12]
]
```
to this, a `4 X 3` matrix:

```
P = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [10, 11, 12]
]
```

What we have achieved: We have first-hand experience, through our own implementations, to vividly describe reshaping with `tensor.view()`, normalization with `transforms.normalize` etc.

You can actually join us at #sg_novice-ai. We have more activities in the pipeline...One of them is **DLDANCE**...Can you visualize how Deep Learning dances?...Haha...Join us to see!

**HONOURABLE MENTIONS: @Ingus Terbets, @Agata [OR, USA], @Hung, @Eman, @Aarthi Alagammai, @Olivia, @Shudipto Trafder, @Hung. Thanks to you for your amazing contributions.**


2. Still reading this book, "The Mathematics of Language": http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/formal.alt.pdf...In smaller bits now as the activties pile.
---------------------


3. ...Matrix tools and its "spin-offs".....and the Pytorch wrapper project...still ongoing
