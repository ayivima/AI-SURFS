### A NEW DAWN BEGINS

A step into the second half of this challenge...Exciting and Frightening :) at the same. I hoped this wouldn't end...Haha.

1. Continued exploring CNNs and Natural Language Processing...It appears as though, there are more points for LSTM and RNNs but, I think "convolutions" offer better hope. 
Language is chaotic: it is random and, yet, has a pattern. One word, can mean many things...but within a context, the differentials narrow down. A practical dynamic system; language is very dynamic. And, convolutional neural networks are great extraction information from dynamic systems. 

2. Explored the Bag-of-words models, N-gram models, Markov models and some challenges of NLP as has persisted with classical ML. Trying to get soaked in all the perspectives, from classic ML to DL to grasp all of this.
This is a pretty old paper, but the writer was futuristic: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J95-1009. 

3. I believe, from my exploration so far, that NLP is in some kind of winter. I was wondering why a lot of competitions are geared toward CV. CV is more popular.
Interestingly, the challenges with language even start with humans, we are as yet to conquer natural language processing ourselves: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227006847_Challenges_in_natural_language_processing_The_case_of_metaphor_commentary/citation/download

4. I also explored how we would apply differential privacy in NLP...Looks like it's in winter too...But, language is probably our greatest liability when it comes to privacy. This was an interesting read along the line: http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2005

5. With all that is going on, I just have to continue being suffocated by the teachings of this book..."The Mathematics of Language": http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/formal.alt.pdf

6. Spent time on the course notebooks.
