### ANOTHER MODEST DAY, BUT EVENTFUL IN THE SHADOWS

I had a stressed day...so I took a break to read on the history of math. I am a fan of the mystery AI has brought to, and has taken from Math at the same. From my experience, AI and Math exist within a space of alternating "Wows" and the "That simple?" moments. But, what fascinates me most is how simple geometry among other math disciplines, like theorems of Pythagoras and Euclid, has evolved into intelligence comparable to the mind - Well, AI power will always be a miniscule of the human mind's power. And, I have been wondering what other part of math we are underrating? There's probably something more to the simple `1 + 1 = 2` theory, which someone must find for the next breakthrough. Then, I woke up from my fantasy to type my progress...Haha


1. Still slowly prepping for a run with all the SPAI stuff...and on the personal projects I started already. For a few days more, I will have a pretty modest and repetitive routine.

2. PYBYTES had a break today...deliberately.

3. Spent time in the Udacity workspace

4. A small byte of this "The Mathematics of Language": http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/Kracht/html/formal.alt.pdf
