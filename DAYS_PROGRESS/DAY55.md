DAY 55
======

I had a tragic miss yesterday.

1. Today was graced with a webinar on Deep Learning with Pytorch by @Labiba, @K.S., @Pooja Vinod

2. Worked on my ML course, and wrote extensions for sklearn as part of course exercises.

3. Special shout out to all those who have made it through the entire 60-Day challenge. It's a remarkable milestone to celebrate.
