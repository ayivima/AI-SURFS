ACTIVITIES

### THE NEW DAWN CONTINUES

1. Attended an inspiring webinar by Udacity: "Putting Humans at the Center of AI", with Dr Fei-Fei Li and Sebastien Thrun, Founder of Udacity. 
She was a pioneer involved in rebboting Ai from winter. She is pursuing some inspiring things for the improvement of healthcare. For instance, using sensors to monitor infection control and patient well-being. Obviously, there is a high attrition rate now, for healthcare workers, and Ai could do a godd job of minimizing the burden.
AI is about 60 years old; that's interesting.

Major takeaways:
- Algorithmic advances are as critical as data publishing. As we better algorithms, we must better data collection and publishing. I guess privacy comes in here as well.
- AI is an interdisciplinary field. A healthy synergistic relationship between the various domains, is critical for the unfolding AI revolution. 
- Interdisciplinary AI will foster oversight for ethics, values and issues that threaten the constructive adoption of AI. If we have the social sciences, for instance, actively involved we could find better ways to guide AI toward collaboration with humans to enhance himans, rather than replacement.
- Essentially, AI was created for humans, and must be centered around humans. As practitioners, we need to have this footprint boldly engineered into our endeavours. If any AI will not help humans, it is not a good idea to pursue.

2. Still investigating CNNs and NLP... 

3. Spent time on the course notebooks... Still exploring the possibilities of feature unions and extensive pipelines for PyTorch.

4. I read through a scholar's syft-js implementation: https://github.com/vvmnnnkv/syft-js-worker. It is a nice one. One of the best things to do in tech is to read a lot of code, and not just write.
