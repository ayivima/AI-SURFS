ON THE LIMITS OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
=====================================



HOW HIGH MUST THE EXPECTATIONS FOR DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY BE?
----------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, we must be appreciative of the limits of differential privacy. DP is not a fix to all our privacy problems. Neither is the combination of differential privacy and its predecessors.
However, we can safely say, it should provide the best privacy-preserving approach as of now, matching with the level at which data hungry systems keep "sniffing" our private data today. Additionally, it is a pretty "young" technology, and it is definitely still
learning to "chew the bones" of data privacy issues.

A deeper understanding of DP also unveils the true essence of the PROMISE. It is not an absolute assurance of non-maleficence. Differential privacy is not absolutely assuring us that we will not be harmed by allowing our sensitive data to be accessed. It rather promises that
it will provide an amount of coverage for our data, in a manner that compares with having our data in private storage, and kept from public access.
Subsequently, with DP, we can access private data and prevent extra harm that would be a result of this access. So that, whether we accessed the private data or not,
the cost of privacy remains the same.


WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT LIMITS OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY?
-----------------------------------------------------

We expect that some privacy costs will be immune to the strategies of DP and its precedecessors. It is expected! Foremost, because
DP is still a growing approach to privacy. Then, DP cannot deal with problems of data storage and other faults of data strategy outside of access. DP is blind to them.

The other twist, probably the most important, is that there are always issues that are resistant to technologies.
At best, we can model these cases as "outliers". They may be considered as special cases, currently resistant to the best of technologies.
Then, proactively, these should be the drivers for research into better privacy-preserving industry approaches - it may take a form of a better DP,
or another strategy with or without the two augmenting each other. The former will be cool.
